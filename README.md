# Bird-Species-classifier
The bird species classifier using CNN is a machine learning model that can identify 6 different bird species based on images of birds. The classifier is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of neural network commonly used for image classification tasks.

The training process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and model evaluation. The images are preprocessed by resizing them to a standard size and normalizing their pixel values. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a few fully connected layers. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with a cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the bird species of an image by feeding the image into the model and obtaining the output class probabilities. The class with the highest probability is taken as the predicted bird species.
